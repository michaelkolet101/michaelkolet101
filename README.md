### Hi Hello ðŸ‘‹
Hi there, I'm Michael Kolt, and I'm a Python developer with a passion for automation in web testing. 
I've always been fascinated with programming, and over the years, I've honed my skills in Python to create 
some pretty impressive automation tools for web testing.

I love the challenge of finding innovative solutions to complex problems, and I take pride in my ability
to streamline processes and increase productivity. Whether I'm working on a personal project or collaborating
with a team, I always strive to deliver the highest quality work.

My GitHub page is a reflection of my passion for programming and automation. It showcases some of my most
notable projects and provides a glimpse into the mind of a dedicated developer. I'm excited to continue
exploring the possibilities of Python and automation in web testing, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me.
